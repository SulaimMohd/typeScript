let someVar = 'some string value' // if assgining the value directly then no need to spefcify the type like varName : typeName. Because typescripe is intelligent enough to assigne the type if directly assignin it which is called type invference which means implicityly returing the type
let newVar : string = 'This is is not require'
let newNumber : number = 33.2

console.log(someVar)

export {}
